# Basic-Voice-Assistant-with-Python.
This is a nice project for beginners. I am used a few libraries you have to download. These are : 1)Speech Recognition #pip install speech_recognition, 2)Playsound #pip install playsound, 3) gTTS #pip install gTTS, 4) Webbrowser #pip install webbrowser .
Thanks for reading my code.
